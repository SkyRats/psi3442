To completely uninstall Docker and remove **all associated data** (containers, images, volumes, configs) on **macOS**, follow the steps below carefully.

---

### 🔥 Full Docker Uninstall (macOS)

#### 1. **Quit Docker**

Make sure Docker is not running:

* Right-click the Docker icon in the macOS menu bar → **Quit Docker Desktop**.

---

#### 2. **Delete Docker Application**

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Applications/Docker.app
```

---

#### 3. **Remove Docker System Files and Settings**

Run the following commands **carefully** to delete all Docker-related data:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
rm -rf ~/.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Docker\ Desktop
rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-desktop
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-ecr-login
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.docker.docker.plist
rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.electron.docker-frontend.savedState
```

You can copy-paste all that into Terminal as one block if you'd like.

---

#### 4. **(Optional) Remove Docker Virtual Disks and Resources**

If you're using **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** or had Docker Desktop running with VM support, also delete:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.helper
rm -rf ~/Library/Logs/Docker\ Desktop
```

---

#### 5. **(Optional) Reclaim Disk Space (Check for Docker.raw)**

Run this to delete the large Docker virtual disk image:

```bash
rm ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/data/Docker.raw
```

> This can be several GB in size.

---

### ✅ To Verify Docker is Gone

Check if any Docker command still works:

```bash
docker --version
```

If you see “command not found,” the uninstall was successful.

---

Let me know if you want a **clean reinstall guide** after this, or want to **back up containers/images** before deleting everything.
